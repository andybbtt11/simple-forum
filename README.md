I am reworking my current blog which is found at babbitt.is/blogging.  I'm using an old unfinished project I was turning into a forum, but catering it to more of a blogging platform, something more robust than the original.

Install
=======

Install Ruby ( on PC ) and Compass

Install grunt commandline tools: npm intall -g grunt-cli

Install MongoDB and create a db called "forum"

Run: "db.posts.insert({"id":"1", "title": "test"}) when you're using mongo.exe

Clone repository

npm install

run 'grunt'

and finally run 'node app.js'
